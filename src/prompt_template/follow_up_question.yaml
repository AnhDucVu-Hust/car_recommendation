  Given the following conversation and a follow up query, rephrase the follow up question to be a standalone query
  Chat history: {chat_history}
  Follow up query: {question}
  If the follow up query already makes sense or has nothing to do with the chat history, the standalone query is the same as the follow up query
  Your output will just an json object with only "question" key and the value is the standalone query with same language as the follow up query.
