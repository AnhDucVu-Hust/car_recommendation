G70 is the internal designation for the seventh generation of the BMW 7 Series, a range of luxury cars produced by the German luxury vehicle manufacturer BMW since July 2022.[1]
 Introduced in April 2022,[7] 7 Series and i7 are the respective designations for BMW's internal combustion and battery electric full-size luxury flagship models. BMW had unveiled the model on 20 April 2022 during the nameplate's 45th anniversary.[8] Sold as a 2023 model,[9] it is longer than its predecessor model. This model offers petrol and diesel models, come standard with a 48-volt mild hybrid powertrain; a plug-in hybrid system is available.[10] Additionally, this model is also the first 7 Series offer a mild hybrid powertrain.[11] The seventh-generation BMW 7 Series is often collectively referred to as the G70.
 The G70 commenced production on 1 July 2022, exactly seven years after the previous model.[12] The i7 is the first 7 Series to offer a fully electric powertrain, which shares powertrains with the smaller G60 i5. Both 7 Series and i7 offer optional rear- or all-wheel drive drivetrains.[13] The V12 model is no longer offered, instead gets replaced by the M760e plug-in hybrid.[14]
 Development:
Development of the G70 commenced in 2017 when BMW began conceiving ideas on how they would replace the G11 / G12.[15] Design concepts had been received from design centres in the United States, Europe and Asia.[15] In 2020, the automaker had announced that diesel models would be carried over, as well as an announcing an electric variant, called the "i7", would be available.[16] The model was spied testing in October 2021, which was the same month that BMW CEO of development Frank Weber had announced the G70 and the G60 would both optionally offer Level 3 autonomous driving. Weber had also made plans for the iX to also offer self-driving.[17] On 4 February 2022, the 7 Series was seen testing again,[18] while on the 22nd, the 7 Series had undergone acoustic testing as a pre-production model.[19]
 The 7 Series was unveiled on 20 April 2022, with a headlight design reminiscent to those of the X7 facelift.[20] 
The G70 7 Series is offered with petrol, plug-in hybrid, diesel, and battery electric powertrains, with the latter being marketed as the i7. A V12 petrol engine option is no longer offered.[8] The vehicle is 130 mm (5.1 in) longer, 48 mm (1.9 in) wider and 51 mm (2.0 in) taller compared to the previous generation long-wheelbase model. China is expected to account for 45 per cent of 7 Series sales. Unlike previous generations, BMW will offer only one length of the G70.[15]
 The G70 is built upon the rear-wheel drive based Cluster Architecture (CLAR) platform shared with the smaller G60 5 Series. This platform was used on the previous model and underpins vehicle that feature a longitudinally mounted combustion engine or a fully-electric drivetrain.[21]
 Markets:
Europe:
In Europe, the initial range only consisted of the i7. Internal combustion versions were available at a later date: the 740d xDrive with a B57 3.0-litre turbo six-cylinder outputting 300 PS (296 hp; 221 kW), along with the 750e xDrive and M760e xDrive plug-in hybrid models. The M760e xDrive is the successor to the V12-powered M760Li.[22]
 North America:
In North America, three trims are available for its late 2022 introduction, including the electric i7 xDrive60, and the internal combustion 740i and 760i xDrive, both equipped with 48 V mild hybrid systems.[23] In 2023, BMW had announced that the 750e xDrive, eDrive50, and M70 had joined the lineup for the 2024 model year.[24]
 Asia:
In Thailand, three trims are available for its November 2022 introduction, including the i7 xDrive60 in 3 models: M Sport, M Sport First Edition, and the range-topping M Sport Gran Lusso. The internal combustion variant with plug-in hybrid model is the 750e xDrive M Sport CKD, introduced in 2023.
 In Malaysia, three variants are available which are the fully electric i7 xDrive60 M Sport,[25] the 750e xDrive Pure Excellence and the 750e xDrive M Sport. The two 750e variants are locally assembled.[26]
 In Indonesia, two variants are available which are the 735i M Sport and i7 xDrive60 Gran Lusso. The 735i M Sport is locally assembled, while the i7 xDrive60 Gran Lusso comes CBU from Germany.
 Presentation:
Design and suspension:
On the front, the G70 incorporates what the brand calls "Iconic Glow", which is BMW's iconic kidney grille that will optionally light up at night to create a kidney effect.[27] The unit features Swarovski crystals as headlamps, which are backlit by fourteen individual LEDs on each side of the vehicle.[28] Unlike the previous model, the G70 aligns the daytime running lamps (DRLs) towards the top of the grille, while a separate panel unit contains the low and high beams positioned towards the middle of the grille, but not connected to it.[29] M Sport models feature a lower front bumper in a contrast colour to the rest of its body, which allowed BMW to add distinct front wheels which creates a more aggressive design compared to its standard specification.[29] Its side profile continues in a familiar way of the front, by keeping its characteristic lines to a minimum. A shoulder line below the glass connects from the daytime running lamps to the edge of the taillights. The Hofmeister kink, an element characteristic of BMW vehicles since the 1950s is placed on the window of the G70.[29] Monotone paint is standard, however two-tone paint is available.
 The i7's drag coefficient is rated at 0.24 Cd,[30] while on ICE models it increases to 0.26 due to engine cooling.[31] As standard, the G70 features double wishbone aluminium suspension at the front, while it features Integral-V multi-link aluminium rear suspension.[32] The G70 additionally features adaptive air suspension, active anti-roll bars, and adaptive dampers.[31] The G70 also features all-wheel steering (Integral Active Steering) with up to 3.5 degrees of turning angle and a 0.76 m (2.5 ft) smaller turning circle of 13.1 m (43 ft)[33] at low speeds.[34] The "Executive Drive Pro" package is available and adds Active Roll Stabilisation and Active Roll Comfort.[35] Unlike its predecessor, the G70 fails to maintain a perfect 50:50 weight distribution, instead has a 49:51 distribution for the base model, and 45:55 for the 760i variant.[36]
 A Pure Excellence design package is available and adds chrome exterior elements and grey brake calipers. The M Sport package offers M Sport Pro package adds M Sport brakes with black gloss calipers, black gloss rear spoiler, an individual high-gloss shadow line on the grille frame and struts, and rear apron trim. The M Performance package adds high-gloss grille surrounds and grille struts, M Sport brakes and a high-gloss black rear spoiler.[37]

BMW i7 :
The BMW i7 model is the battery electric variant of the G70.[60] Unveiled simultaneously with its ICE counterpart,[61] the vehicle features a similar powertrain setup to the iX crossover SUV, including an excited synchronous electric motor at the rear for rear-wheel drive models while on all-wheel drive models, two motors are placed at both front and rear axles.[62] These models are built upon a 400 V architecture, meaning it allows DC fast charging. The i7 is the only model to be available with the Executive Lounge package. These models are built at the same assembly line in Dingolfing has the internal combustion models, as well as its E-segment counterpart.[63]
 The models are fitted with BMW's in-house made electric motors, seen on the I20 iX and the G60 i5. The i7's gross and usable battery capacities are rated at 105.7 kWh and 101.7 kWh, respectively.[64][65][66] The lithium-ion units have a battery voltage of 376.4 V, producing an all-electric range of up to 625 km (388 mi).[64] The singular motor eDrive50, which was introduced in May 2023 as the entry-level i7, features BMW's eDrive which produces an output of 355 kW (476 hp) and 650 N⋅m (479 lbf⋅ft). Its estimated all-electric range is 520 km (323 mi) at a WLTP standard.[67] The xDrive60 features dual eDrive motors which produce a combined output of 355 kW (476 hp) and 650 N⋅m (479 lbf⋅ft).[68] All-electric driving ranges from 591–625 km (367–388 mi).[69] The range-topping M70 xDrive model features dual eDrive motors that produce a combined output of 485 kW (650 hp) and 1,100 N⋅m (811 lbf⋅ft).[70]
 Engineers of the i7 have made minimal updates to the regenerative braking system from the other full-electric iX and i4 models. The driver can select different regenerative braking levels and use the highest level for one-pedal driving. Adaptive recuperation is the standard configuration when in driving position D. The driver can experience three levels of brake regeneration settings, low, medium and high.[71]
 Batteries are positioned beneath the floor,[72] and due to this, boot/trunk space decreases from 540 litres (19 cu ft) on the ICE models to 500 litres (18 cu ft).[44]

Charging:
For the eDrive50 and xDrive60 models, AC slow charging via an 11 kW Type 2 connector will take 11 hours. DC fast charging for the eDrive50 and xDrive60 at a capacity of 195-200 kW via a CCS port for a 10-80% charge will take a time of 28 minutes.[67] The M70 model uses the same charging ports as the other i7s, however, slow charging will take a time of 5 hours and 30 minutes.[73] BMW's available wallbox charger can charge at a rate of up to 22 kW and will take just shy of 10 hours. The i7s also come with the Flexible Fast Charger compatible with any 120 or 240V outlet. A 0-100% charge will take just under 12 hours.[74] In the US, the i7 is able to charge with the "Electrify America" DC fast charger, which may add 180 to 200 mi (290 to 320 km) of electric range in a 30-minute session.[74] The model can also charge with a J1772 port in North America with a control box (32A adjustable).[75]

 Special models:
 BMW 7 First Edition:
BMW Japan celebrated the start of production for the G70 by making a limited edition "First Edition" model.[77] This model is available in three trims: 740i Excellence, 740i M Sport, and the battery electric i7 xDrive60 Excellence. All models feature the 31.3 in (800 mm) 8K rear screen in the rear passenger area with a 1,965W, 40-speaker Bowers & Wilkins sound system. This model also adds the Rear Comfort package that will feature multi-function rear seats with heating, ventilation, and massaging.[78] 150 examples were made, and the model was available from the final quarter of 2022.[78]
  BMW 7 Protection (G73):
Internally designated G73,[79] the BMW 7 Series Protection is an armoured variant of the G70.[80] This model is a bulletproof variant, and is available in both 760i and i7 guises. The armoured G73 was unveiled in August 2023,[80] and revives the tradition of the Protected 7 Series line that was first introduced on the E38 "Protection Line" model, but was discontinued on the G11.[81] The G73 features a "Protection Core", which allows it to survive ballistic attacks or explosions, proven by extensive studies officially confirmed by German test facility Beschussamt Muenchen.[82] Passenger doors can be equipped with the emergency exit system.[82] The armoured inner core surrounds the passenger compartment and invisibly protects the occupants of the vehicle. The G73 also includes the BMW Protection Command Touch System, which features protection-relevant options and additional comfort features.[82] The vehicle also features 20-inch alloy wheels with Michelin PAX system tires. These wheels help for shorter braking distance and improved acceleration.[82] Compared to the standard specification 760i which has a top speed of 250 km/h (155 mph) and a 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) time of 4.2 seconds, the armoured variant has an electronically limited top speed of 210 km/h (130 mph) and a 0-100 km/h (62 mph) time of 6.6 seconds.[83] The electric i7 Protection has a top speed of 160 km/h (99 mph) and a 0-100 km/h (62 mph) time of 9 seconds.[84]
