The BMW 4 Series is a range of compact executive cars manufactured by BMW since 2013. The 4 Series was created when BMW spun off the 2-door models (coupé and convertible) of the 3 Series into a separate series. The 4 Series is currently in its second generation.
 The original 4 Series concept car was unveiled in January 2013 at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan.[1][2] Both generations have been produced in the coupé, convertible and 5-door liftback (marketed as "Gran Coupé") body styles. The 4 series body style is very similar to that of the all electric BMW i4.[3]
 The engines available for the first generation were turbocharged inline-3, inline-4 and inline-6 engines fueled by petrol or diesel. For the second generation, a plug-in hybrid powertrain was introduced. As per the equivalent 3 Series generations, the 4 Series' drivetrain layout is rear-wheel drive or all-wheel drive ("xDrive").
 The BMW M4 is the high-performance version of the 4 Series. The first generation of the M4 is called the F82/F83 and uses the same turbocharged inline-six petrol engine as the F80/F81 M3.
 First generation (F32/F33/F36; 2013):
The first generation of the 4 Series consists of the following body styles:
 - 2-door coupé (F32 model code)
- 2-door convertible (F33 model code)
- 4-door liftback (F36 model code; marketed as the 4 Series Gran Coupé)
This generation was produced from 2014 to 2020 and is often collectively referred to as the F32. The F32 was introduced as the successor to the E92/E93 coupé/convertible models of the fifth-generation 3 Series range. The F32 is produced alongside - and shares many features with - the F30 3 Series. As with the F30 3 Series range, the F32/F33/F36 is powered by turbocharged petrol and diesel engines with 3 cylinders (petrol only), 4 cylinders, and 6 cylinders.
 The high performance F82/F83 M4 models were introduced in early 2014.[4] They are powered by the S55 turbocharged straight-six engine.

Second generation (G22/G23/G26; 2020):
The second generation of the 4 Series consists of the following body styles:
 - 2-door coupé (G22 model code)
- 2-door convertible (G23 model code)
- 5-door liftback (G26 model code; marketed as the 4 Series Gran Coupé)
This generation was launched in June 2020 and is currently in production. The G22/G23/G26 will be produced alongside - and shares many features with - the G20 3 Series. As with the G20 3 Series range, the G22/G23/G26 will be powered by turbocharged petrol and diesel engines.
 
Unlike its predecessor, the new 4 Series has a significant departure in design from the 3 Series in order to distinguish between the two models and to move the 4 Series upscale. The most notable of the design changes is the large kidney grille at the front which was inspired by the 1930s BMW 328.[5] -
