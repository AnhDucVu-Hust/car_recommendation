-----------------------------------------  --------------------------The BMW 2 Series is a range of subcompact executive cars (C-segment) manufactured by BMW since 2014. The 2 Series was created when BMW spun-off the 2-door models (coupé and convertible) of the BMW 1 Series into a separate series.
 The 2 Series was first launched as a 2-door coupé and convertible, both based on a rear-wheel drive platform. A year later, the Active Tourer 5-seat compact MPV body style was added, based on the unrelated front-wheel drive platform shared with the Mini Hatch (F55/56/57). This was followed by a 7-seat version called the Gran Tourer.[1] In 2019, the Gran Coupé fastback sedan joined the 2 Series family as a front-wheel drive vehicle based on the 1 Series hatchback and has been marketed as a 4-door coupe. In 2021, BMW released the second-generation 2-door coupé, rear-wheel drive 2 Series in July 2021.[2]
 The BMW M2 is the high-performance version of the 2 Series 2-door coupé. The first generation of the M2 is the F87 coupé and is powered by turbocharged straight-six engines.
 Coupé/convertible:
First generation (F22/F23; 2014):
The first-generation 2 Series was a rear-wheel-drive 2-door coupé (F22 model code), and 2-door convertible (F23 model code). This generation started production in November 2013 as the successor to the E82 1 Series coupé and E88 1 Series convertible. It was produced in Leipzig, previously alongside the F20 1 Series hatchback range.[3] There were many different models including the 220, 228, 230, and the range topping version of the coupe (F22 model code), the M235i which used the BMW N55 engine. This was later replaced by the M240 which used the BMW B58 engine.
 The coupé version of the 2 Series was used as the basis of the high performance F87 M2 model. The M2 was powered by two different turbocharged inline-six engines, the BMW N55 in the original version, and later the BMW S55 in the Competition and CS models.

Second generation (G42; 2021):

The second-generation 2 Series coupé was revealed in July 2021 as the successor to the F22 2 Series coupé and convertible. Remaining a rear-wheel-drive-based model, the G42 is built on the CLAR platform with a roughly 50 50 weight distribution and shares many mechanical components and engine options with the G20 3 Series and G22 4 Series. The second-generation 2 Series is not available with a manual transmission or as a convertible.[4][5][6] The launch models consist of the mild hybrid diesel engine 220d, the petrol engine 220i and 230i and the top M240i xDrive. The G42 2 Series is exclusively produced in BMW's San Luis Potosí plant in Mexico, and the first BMW vehicle designed by BMW of Mexico. Production of the G42 2 Series commenced on 2 September 2021.[7] Active Tourer/Gran Tourer:
The BMW 2 Series Active Tourer is a five-door, two-row compact MPV produced since 2014. The vehicle is built on the front-wheel drive-based UKL2 platform with an optional all-wheel drive (xDrive). It is the first BMW-branded model to not use the rear-wheel drive configuration. A longer version with three-row seating called the BMW 2 Series Gran Tourer was released shortly after in 2015.
 Gran Coupé (F44; 2019):
BMW revealed a four-door sedan variant under the 2 Series range in October 2019 as the BMW 2 Series Gran Coupé. It is built on the front-wheel drive UKL2 platform like the Active Tourer (F45) and Gran Tourer (F46).[8] In markets where the vehicle is being sold, it is the smallest four-door sedan offered by BMW, except in China and Mexico where the smaller F52 1 Series sedan is offered.
